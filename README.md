# Automat

Automat is a partial imitation of the FRC (FIRST Robotics Competition) robot control library WPILib, an open source library built and maintained by the Worchester Polytechnic Institute. WPILib's most outstanding benefit is its simple and efficient command-based robot framework dividing the robot into commands and subsystems. Automat provides most of the basic functionality of WPILib to VEX and Esp32 architectures.

Automat is still in production and does not include all WPILib features, but it contains all of the basic building blocks. A full catalogue of included features and the few slight differences from WPILib syntax can be found under documentation.md.

Examples of the Automat library in use can be found in Explothusist/Stormbot-Codebase, linked below.
